I’m **Cameron Movassaghi**.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Jesse Meyer lab in the Department of Computational Biomedicine at Cedars-Sinai. My research spans the subjects of -omics (particularly, proteomics and metabolomics), aging-related diseases, and automated tools for high-throughput drug screening. I am particularly interested in how laboratory automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence can accelerate laboratory discoveries relevant to improving human health.

I recieved my PhD in Analytical Chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2024. I was advised by Anne M. Andrews, and my research focused on neurochemical sensor development and machine learning  for voltammetry. We developed analytical techniques, software, and data analysis pipelines to detect neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine in the brains of awake, behaving mice, in real-time.

Prior to graduate school, I was a post-baccelaurate research fellow at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA. This experience was my introduction to metabolomics and operating liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry instruments on a daily basis, including method development, maintenance and troubleshooting. We specialized in high-throughput, absolute quantification of urinary and blood biomarkers of volatile organic compounds.

I recieved my B.S. in Chemistry (with Distinction) and an Entrepreneurship minor from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Organic chemistry piqued my interest in pursuing science as a career, and as such I was undergraduate researcher in the Crimmins group. My project was on the total synthesis of a bioactive red algae metabolite with potential therapeutic properties. As part of the Entrepreneurship minor, I interned at a biomedical device start-up company (HyperBranch Medical Technology, Inc; now acquired by Stryker). Here, I worked in the synthesis and analytical labs, along with the manufacturing cleanroom, to produce their neurosurgical sealant polymer and applicator. This experience was my introduction to the true power of analytical chemistry and applications to the brain, which motivated my graduate school aspirations.

Outside of research, I enjoy running, skiing, exploring the world of coffee.
