I’m **Cameron Movassaghi**.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Jesse Meyer lab in the Department of Computational Biomedicine at Cedars-Sinai. My research spans topics like:

I recieved my PhD in Analytical Chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2024. I was advised by Anne M. Andrews, and my research focused on neurochemical sensor development and machine learning  for voltammetry.

Outside of research, I enjoy running, skiing, exploring the world of coffee
