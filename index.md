## Hi, I'm Cameron Movassaghi!

### Short Biography
Born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, I became fascinated by chemistry in high school. I then attended UNC Chapel Hill. During the summers, I worked at a medical device start up company in the Triangle area, which introduced me to the many possibilities of scientific innovation. In 2016, I graduated (with distinction) with a B.Sc. in Chemistry and minor in Entrepreneurship.

Learning my lesson from a short stint total synthesis undegraduate research, I realized I was much more fascinated with the characterization techniques than the syntheses itself. Although organic chemistry will always be my first academic 'love', analytical is what turned me towards becoming a professional chemist.

From 2016-19, I was an ORISE Research Fellow at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Here, I learned the art of chromatography and mass spectrometry at the intersection of big data, public health, bioanalytical chemistry. It was here I decided to return to school for doctoral work in analytical chemistry.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Analytical Chemistry at UCLA. For more details see [our lab website](https://serotonin.ucla.edu//).

### Scientific Interests
I am interested in how data informs chemistry and vice versa. 

How can we make the invisible become visible? The ability of analytical chemistry to reveal the molecular make-up of matter is utterly fascinating.

Add in how to do this quantitiveley, and how to extract the maximum information from chemical data, I became interested in machine learning and chemometric techniques to make these measurements at the cutting-edge.

However, the bottom line is always having the sheer luck to use my passion (chemistry) to better humankind and human health.
